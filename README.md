## The Team 

This project is a for Kennesaw State University, completed by **Frank Anello** and **Vladimir Juarez-Zayas**. We will be following other guides online to help us along our way.

## The Guide we are following

We will be following this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY&t=1s) video as a guide along the way for this project. 

## How to Use

Find the url of the Amazon product you wish to monitor and insert it first input asked

Go to your internet browser and search "my user agent", then insert your user agent in line 9 of the code.

Go to line 39 and insert your email address in place of the 2nd email address there (if not using default gmail).

Enter wanted price when asked for input.

Enter email that notification will be sent to.

Lastly change how often you want to monitor the Amazon product by updating line 44 with the amount of seconds in between each time you check the page. For example 60 would check the Amazon product every minute.
